# Advent of Code 2022

[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

After reading _Clean Code_ at the beginning of this year, my focus has been on writing... clean code.

I see the appeal of doing advent of code in as few lines as possible, or learning a new programming language, but given my focus this year, I have opted to come up with the most readable and concise solutions possible.

If you happen to stumble across this, I would love to hear your thoughts or areas for improvement in my solutions.

Cheers,  
Brian
